Abbreviation
  QSL-1.0-0BSD

Notice
  Copyright 2026 Quad4

Terms and Conditions

Licensor ("We")
  The party offering the Software under these Terms and Conditions.

The Software
  The "Software" is each version of the software that we make
  available under these Terms and Conditions, as indicated by our
  inclusion of these Terms and Conditions with that version. Each
  version is offered separately; rights in one version do not affect
  rights in any other.

0BSD Effective Date
  The "0BSD Effective Date" of a version of the Software is the second
  anniversary of the date we first make that version available. Each
  version's license header or LICENSE file will state its 0BSD
  Effective Date. The date stated there is conclusive.

License Grant
  Subject to the terms and conditions below, we grant you a worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge license to use, copy, modify, create
  derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, and
  redistribute the Software for any Permitted Purpose.

Permitted Purpose
  A Permitted Purpose is any purpose other than a Competing Use.

  "Commercial" means in connection with a business or for pecuniary
  gain.

  A Competing Use means making the Software, or a modification or
  derivative of it, available to others in connection with a
  commercial product or service that:

    1. substitutes for the Software;

    2. substitutes for any other product or service we offer using the
       Software as of the date we first make the Software available;
       or

    3. offers functionality the same as or substantially similar to
       the Software's as the product or service's own functionality,
       rather than including the Software as one component among
       others in a larger work.

  Making the Software available to others includes offering the
  Software, or use of it, over a network, whether or not copies are
  distributed.

  Distributing or operating a product or service that includes the
  Software as a component is not, by itself, a Competing Use; it is a
  Competing Use only if clause 1, 2, or 3 is otherwise met.

  Permitted Purposes specifically include using the Software:

    1. for your internal use and access;

    2. for non-commercial education;

    3. for non-commercial research; and

    4. in connection with professional services that you provide to a
       licensee using the Software in accordance with these Terms and
       Conditions.

Commercial Licensing
  If your intended use is a Competing Use or is otherwise not a
  Permitted Purpose, contact the Licensor to obtain a commercial
  license. We may offer commercial licenses on negotiated terms.

Patents
  Subject to your compliance with these Terms and Conditions for so
  long as they govern your use, we and each contributor to the
  Software grant you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
  no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under our patent claims
  that are necessarily infringed by the Software, or by the
  combination of the Software with our materials for which such
  claims are licensed, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
  import, and otherwise transfer the Software for any Permitted
  Purpose and, on and after the 0BSD Effective Date, for any purpose.

  If you institute patent litigation against any party (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
  Software, or a contribution to it, constitutes direct or
  contributory patent infringement, then your patent license for the
  Software terminates as of the date such litigation is filed.

Contributions
  Unless you state otherwise in writing, any contribution you
  intentionally submit for inclusion in the Software is submitted
  under these Terms and Conditions. You grant us a perpetual,
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
  perform, publicly display, distribute, and sublicense the
  contribution, including any patent claims necessary to do so and to
  license the Software containing it under these Terms and Conditions
  and under the 0BSD license.

Redistribution
  These Terms and Conditions apply to all copies, modifications, and
  derivatives of the Software.

  If you redistribute any copies, modifications, or derivatives of
  the Software, you must include a copy of or a link to these Terms
  and Conditions and not remove any copyright notices provided in or
  with the Software.

Termination
  Your rights under these Terms and Conditions end automatically if
  you fail to comply with them. If the failure can be cured, your
  rights are reinstated when you cure it and take reasonable steps to
  prevent its recurrence. Termination of your patent license under
  the Patents clause is permanent.

Grant of Future License
  We hereby irrevocably grant you an additional license to use the
  Software under the 0BSD license, effective on the 0BSD Effective
  Date for that version. On or after that date, you may use the
  Software under the 0BSD license, in which case the following will
  apply:

  TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
  PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

Severability

  minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining
  provisions remain in effect.
